# ECE 252 Communication Systems Project - Spring 2025

This project is developed for the Analog and Digital Communication Systems course at Ain Shams University.

## Contents

### ðŸ“¡ Analog Communication

- Time and frequency domain analysis of signals
- Filtering with different bandwidths
- Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) with DSB-SC and SSB
- Coherent demodulation of modulated signals

### ðŸ”„ Digital Communication

- Line coding comparison (e.g., Manchester vs. NRZ)
- Modulation and demodulation of digital signals (ASK, FSK, PSK)
- Spectral and temporal analysis
- Effect of receiver oscillator phase shift

## Language & Tools

- [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)

## How to Run

Each folder contains its own `.m` files. Run in Octave using:

```bash
octave your_script_name.m
